# StellarMicroLend

**StellarMicroLend** is a decentralized micro-lending platform built on the Stellar blockchain. It enables individuals and small businesses to request and provide microloans with transparency, low fees, and blockchain-backed trust. With smart contract support and wallet integration, users can interact with real on-chain credit systems in a simple, user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is to facilitate access to financial services in underserved communities by offering a lightweight lending protocol on the Stellar network. By using blockchain transaction history, a more accurate and transparent credit score can be generated for users — enabling safer loan decisions.
